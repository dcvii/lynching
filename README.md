## Lynching Stats in the USA

When it comes to the discussion of race in America, many are quick to bring up the matter of death, and it is quite appropriate for them to do so. If there is any reality to the suffering of black Americans that cannot be ignored, murder is the most salient crime. 

While I have no doubts that there are various other crimes including rape, assault, fraud, and violent threats that have been leveled at African Americans through their history, I suspect that they share the trends of that of the most heinous crime of all, lynching. However my aim here is not to characterize the nature or import of those crimes, but to insure that the best data about the specific counts of lynching are preserved.

## Organization

There are two subdirectories here. One is for data, and the other for documents. The documents are used without permission for educational purposes only. The data are the most accurate I can get my hands on. These are the identical numbers to be found in the Internet Archive. (https://archive.org/details/tuskegeelynchingstatistics)


## Contextual Background

I originally came across the lynching figures in the data section from a publication from Tuskeegee Institute in October of 2010. I published them to my blog under the heading American Lynchings. Prior to that date, I had listened to an NPR show staring Eric Foner (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Foner) who gave me an approximate figure of about 3000, as the total number of African Americans lynched in the post Civil War era. 

I was shocked to find the number to be that low. I expected at least 10 times that. This show was recoreded somewhere between 2000 and 2003, longer than NPR keeps public searchable archives. 

I recall this specifically because during that period I had written publiclly that I beleived anti-black racism to be more deadly than communism. This assertion kept up my skepticism about the value and validity of Republican anti-communist claims. I was specifcally unaware of the crimes of Stalin at that time. Eventually, this new knowledge readjusted my estimation of the damage done in the world by the various evil forces of the 19th and 20th centuries. 

Subsequent to this discovery, I adjusted my sense of moral outrage in all of my writing. 

## Adjustments and Qualifications

I have noted in my 'Update to American Lynchings' in October of 2015 that the Equal Justice Initiative (https://eji.org/) has laid claim to an undercount by Tuskeegee. However they have not published comprehensively specific figures, only excerpts from the data, which I have included in the document section. 

I will make an effort to get that full set which I will publish here.
